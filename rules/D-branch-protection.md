## §D — Protected branches

The protected branches are the ones `.rsct.json` declares in
`protected_branches[]`, plus anything listed in `protected_patterns_extra`.
When the key is absent, the framework protects `main`, `master`, `test` and
`dev` by default. Treat that list — never a fixed set of names memorised from
this text — as the authority; `rsct_status` reports the list in force.
Without explicit reconfirmed authorization for the current action:

- Prohibited: git commit, git push, git merge (incoming or outgoing),
  git rebase, git reset, force push, or checkout for editing.
- Allowed without OK per action: reading (git log, git diff, git show)
  and temporary checkout for inspection with immediate return to another branch.
- For any mutating work: create a derived branch (feat/, fix/, chore/, docs/)
  and open a PR.

**"Merge" = any of GitHub's three PR methods.** Wherever this framework says
"merge" (the §C `rsct_request_merge`, or a PR), it covers **merge commit**
(`gh pr merge --merge`), **squash and merge** (`--squash`), and **rebase and
merge** (`--rebase`) — there is no fourth method. After a merge/PR completes by
ANY of them, **and once the task's plan/progress/spec work is done**, proactively
**suggest** (optional, the dev's OK, never automatic): delete the **working
branch** (local + remote — `git branch -d` / `git push origin --delete`, GitHub's
"Delete branch", or `gh pr merge --delete-branch`) and the
`plan_/progress_/spec_<slug>.md` tracking files. When `rsct-mcp` is installed,
record the keep|delete decision with `rsct_plan_dispose` (plan-lifecycle-v2) —
it prints an **advisory** cleanup report and **never auto-deletes**, and it works
for the GitHub-PR-merge terminal too (where neither `rsct_request_merge` nor
`_push` runs). A PR-level squash/rebase runs via `gh` / the web UI, so raising the
suggestion is on you. (In `plan_file_retention: documented` mode, `spec_<slug>.md`
is kept — tracked as durable design docs.)

**Pre-integration hygiene checklist (before any outward integration):**

Before you integrate outward — a merge, a GitHub PR (any of the three
methods), or a **push to a protected branch** — run a quick hygiene
checklist and confirm it with the dev:

1. Is the task/phase work actually **complete**?
2. Are the pertinent **ADRs recorded** (→ §H)? (Confirm the ones already
   surfaced this session are written — this is not a new proposal round.)
3. Are the associated **issues resolved**?
4. Have the files this integration carries been **swept** for dead code and for
   comments that no longer match the code? List them.

Item 4 applies at **every tier** — there is no `trivial`/`small` exemption. An
agent produces residue at every size of task, and residue that reaches the
codebase is paid for by every task after it.

Where the sweep is **practised** and where it is **enforced** are different
points, deliberately. Practise it at the refactor moment, right after the code
works and while the context is still warm. It is enforced later, at the
integration boundary, because that is where residue would otherwise become
permanent.

When `rsct-mcp` is installed, `rsct_request_merge` (always), `rsct_request_push`
(when the branch is protected), and `rsct_request_rebase` (local rebase/squash,
plan-lifecycle-v2) enforce this mechanically via `pre_merge_ack` (§C) — the ack
is a self-attestation except for two items, which RSCT cross-checks against the
repository: `plan_complete` (against open `- [ ]` items in the plan's progress)
and `hygiene_swept` (against `files_swept[]`, see below). Answer it honestly;
marking any item false is honored as a stop.

Item 4 additionally carries **`files_swept[]`**, and that one is not a
self-attestation: RSCT reads the paths the integration really carries out of git
and rejects when one of them is missing from your list, **whatever the booleans
say**. Get the same list it reads with
`git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d <base>...<head>`, and use the range for your
operation: merge → `HEAD...<source_branch>` · rebase → `<ref>...HEAD` ·
squash → `HEAD...<ref>` · push → `<remote>/<dest_branch>...<source_ref>`. It checks
**coverage** — that the carried paths were claimed as swept — not that a sweep
happened or found anything. **A local rebase/squash now has a §C-gated tool**
(`rsct_request_rebase`, which requires its own `pre_merge_ack`); **only PR merges
via `gh`/the web UI still have no MCP tool** — there the checklist is **yours to
run as prose** before the outward-facing action. A push to a non-protected
feature/WIP branch is not an integration and does not need the checklist.

Even if the user authorized a push on a protected branch in the same session,
the next push on that branch requires an updated OK (§C — authorization does
not reuse). Exception: the current session may be working directly on a
protected branch by explicit user decision — even in this case, each mutating
action on the protected branch still requires OK per action.

**Active branch verification at task boundaries:**

At the start of every task and after any pause (planning done → new task,
resume after break, switch context), run:
```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If the current branch differs from the branch where a prior plan was approved
(visible in `plan_<slug>.md` metadata, if present):
- Explicitly ask the developer which branch to continue work in.
- Do NOT assume the current branch is intentional.

If the current branch is one of the protected branches declared in
`.rsct.json` (or one of the defaults, when the key is absent):
- Strongly recommend creating a new derived branch before any mutation.
- Recommend reusing the existing working branch from `plan_<slug>.md` if
  the task is a continuation.

**§D and the M3 phase machine (when `rsct-mcp` is installed):**

The Code phase (§B-approved plan moving into execution) is wrapped by:

1. `mcp__rsct__rsct_phase_code_start({ spec_ref, scope_globs, spec_tier })` —
   declare the files this phase intends to mutate. The `scope_globs[]`
   is the per-phase contract. **Pass `spec_tier`** from your earlier
   `rsct_classify_task` result: `trivial`/`small` bypass the
   verification gate; `standard`/`complex` are rejected unless the V
   phase was completed for the same `spec_ref` (CAP-28). To skip V
   intentionally on a standard/complex task, pass
   `override_verification_skip: true` — the override is audit-logged.
2. Before each `Edit` / `Write`:
   `mcp__rsct__rsct_check_edit_scope({ file_path })` returns
   `in_scope` / `out_of_scope` / `unknown`. If `out_of_scope`, STOP
   and ask the dev to expand `scope_globs` (via re-opening spec) or
   to defer the edit. The check is read-only and cheap — call it for
   every Edit, not just the first one.
3. `mcp__rsct__rsct_phase_code_complete({ spec_ref, dev_approval })`
   — §C gate after all edits land.
4. The REVIEW phase (when `include_review:true` was recorded at
   spec_complete): `rsct_phase_review_start` → review the diff →
   `rsct_phase_review_complete`. Then `rsct_phase_test_start({ spec_ref,
   spec_tier })` — for `standard`/`complex` it rejects unless the review
   decision is honored (completed, or `include_review:false`), bypassable
   with `override_review_skip: true` (audit-logged). The recommended
   cycle is R→S→V→C→REVIEW→T.

The branch derivation step above is INDEPENDENT of and PRECEDES the
phase machine: derive `feat/<slug>` (or equivalent) FIRST, then open
the code phase on the derived branch. Mutating on a protected branch
remains forbidden regardless of how `scope_globs` is declared.
